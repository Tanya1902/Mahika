Priyanka’s interesting personality and repository of ideas have been phenomenal in getting MMF where it is. She is looking forward to learning ballet sometime in the future, and dreams of becoming an entrepreneur.

Her magical designs have brought life to the website. Harishna wants to learn how to drive, and travel around, hopefully overcoming her fear of scary pigeons.

                                A full-on talent, he applies his hyper-attention to details. And he probably does photography when he's not with us. He can’t start his day without meditation. Since childhood, he has always drawn zig zag lines on walls, and feared snakes. He wants to learn violin, so he can show-off. Whenever we ask for a favour, Alex would say, ‘Hey, me.’ Perhaps that’s why he dreams of serving the people.

Chocolates and her laptop. She dreams of being a popular dancer and touring the world.

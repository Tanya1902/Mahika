My contribution for Mahika Mishra Foundation's website development for its Letters for change initiative is showcased in this repository.I have done this during my internship with this progressive NGO during June-August 2020.
Mahika Mishra Foundation (MMF)-founded in 2019, is a non-profit organization based in Mumbai. MMF aims to create opportunities for children to express their opinions and concerns. Mahika observed that globally, children do not have the right to vote. Most of their decisions are taken by adults. 
To change this, Mahika Mishra Foundation runs Letters for Change, an initiative that wants children to write letters on issues they think will change their lives. MMF will take these letters to the right people, creating awareness about these issues.
